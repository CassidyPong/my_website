						<h2>Little Red Riding Hood</h2>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section>
					<div>
						<p>Once upon a time, there was a little girl. Her grandmother gave her a red riding hood, and the girl loves it so much she wears it all the time. So everybody started to call her Little Red Riding Hood.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section>
					<div>
						<p>One day mother told the girl her grandmother fell ill. Because she lived alone deep in the wood, she would probably be happy to get some food. Then mother gave a basket with food and a bottle of wine to Little Red Riding Hood and told her: "Don't stray from the path!"</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section>
					<div>
						<p>The girl promised but soon forgot about her mother's warning. After a while, she met a wolf in the wood. He asked her where she was going and she told him about her granny's bad health and where she lives. </p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section>
					<div>
						<p>The wolf tricked her to stop and pick some flowers. She did that and in the meantime, the wolf ran to the granny's house. The wolf, pretending to be her granddaughter, entered the grandmother's house and ate the lady. Then he dressed in her nightgown and waited for Little Red Riding Hood.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section>
					<div>
						<p>When she came in, she noticed that something was different with her grandmother.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section>
					<div>
						<p>"My! What big eyes you have, Grandma!" she said in surprise. "All the better to see you with, my dear!" replied the wolf. "My! What big ears you have, Grandma!" said Little Red Riding Hood. "All the better to hear you with, my dear!" said the wolf. "What big teeth you have, Grandma!" said Little Red Riding Hood. "All the better to eat you with!" growled the wolf pouncing on her. </p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section>
					<div>
						<p>Soon after a huntsman came by the house and heard snoring. He entered cautiously, saw the sleeping monster in granny's bed and guessed what happened. Then he opened sleeping wolf's stomach with a knife. </p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section>
					<div>
						<p>Granny and Red Riding Hood came out and helped the huntsman to fill wolf's stomach with stones. When the wolf woke up, he tried to run away, but stones were too heavy. He fell; down and died. And so, the Grandmother, granddaughter, and huntsman lived happily ever after.</p>
