	<p> Born and raised in the bay area, Cassidy Pong is a current student at SJSU studying under the major of Digital Media Art. She works in a variety of mediums ranging from tradition art forms such as sketching, drawing, and painting, but also works in technological and 3 Dimensional forms such as photography, video, sculpture, and 3D modeling and printing. Most of her artwork is focused on personal experiences and emotions that she has experienced throughout her life; though they may be uncomfortable or dismal to think of, they are done in a more subtle, less obvious way. </p>
