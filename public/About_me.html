	<p> Born and raised in the bay area, Cassidy Pong is an interdisciplinary, digital media artist recognized for her complex and ambitious works. Currently, she is a student at San Jose State University expecting to receive her BFA in Digital Media Art. She works in a variety of different mediums ranging from traditional art forms such as sketching, drawing, and painting, to digital artwork and three dimensional forms such as photography, video, sculpture, and 3D modeling and printing. A lot of her artwork is focused on personal experiences and emotions that she has experienced throughout her life: such as depression, loss, sadness, and self-conflict. By placing herself into her work, she is able to make a better connection to her work and practice as well as with her viewers. </p>
