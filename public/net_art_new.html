		<h1>Brief History</h1>
</div>
<div>
	<p> Not many people know the true story behind the Disney fairy-tales; mostly based off the Brothers Grimm stories 
	(19th century, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm), the original fairy-tales typically consisted of dark, gruesome themes in comparison to 
	what we know today. Many (if not most) of the Brothers Grimm stories involve death, pain, gore, incest, etc. On 
	the other hand, the Walt Disney versions are catered toward a younger, more innocent audience. Therefore the stories
	are more cheerful, light-hearted, optimistic, and full of happy-endings.
	</p>
	
	<p> The time periods between the two are drastically different. Based off of German folklore, the Grimm brothers 
	sought to preserve a collection of folk-tales that were spread orally. They intended the stories to be directed more
	toward an adult audience, addressing themes such as death, violence, sex, rape, etc. However, these stories were 
	not widely accepted causing them to revise their stories, but not by much:ie.'mother' changed to 'stepmother' and 
	references tosex were removed.Gradually, the fairy-tales became more conservative: violence and gory details were
	removed, appealing to adults who finally felt comfortable
	reading these stories to their children.

		<h1>Artist's Statement</h1>

<div>
	<p> In this nonlinear narrative, I wanted to explore and bring into light the "darker side of things." Since most 
	people do not know the original stories, I wanted to capitalize on the efficiency and convenience of the internet.
	First, I wanted to establish a clear difference between the Disney stories and the Grimm stories by using
	different colors, text, interactivity, and layout. For the Disney stories, I decided to create a interactive 
	book where the viewer can flip actual pages to read through the story. On the other hand, I settled with
	simple text for the Grimm stories, but I included a "TL;DR" (aka too long, didn't read) on the right side
	for people who do not want to read the entire story since they are very, very long. All of the stories link 
	to one another; one can jump from story to story allowing he/she to compare the differences between the Disney 
	side and the Grimm side.
	</p>
	
	<p> In total, there are twenty stories: Cinderella (Disney & Grimm), Rapunzel (Disney & Grimm), Hansel and 
	Gretel (Disney & Grimm), Little Red Riding Hood (Disney & Grimm), Snow White and the Seven Dwarves (Disney & Grimm),
	Sleeping Beauty (Disney & Grimm), Princess and the Frog (Disney & Grimm), The Little Mermaid, Rumpelstiltskin,
	The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids, The Golden Bird, The Seven Ravens, and the Twelve Brothers. Though there are 
	only twenty stories listed, there are many more Grimm stories including: Godfather Death, The Girl without Hands, 
	The White Snake,  The Dog and the Sparrow, Hans the Hedgehog, and many, many more. Personally, I find their stories very 
	interesting and rather engaging. The formality in which the story is told also has its own characteristic, 
	giving a different feel to the story as well.
