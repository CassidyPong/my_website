<h3> Artist Statement </h3>

<p>When creating the animation in addition to sound, I decided to put the main focus on the subject in my piece. In this case, “the girl with the umbrella.” By focusing primarily on creating movement in the center of the image, it almost creates a space frozen in time. It places the viewer in her world. I also added additional images of the girl to make it appear as if she is walking away toward the background. In a way, this also draws in the viewer as well as she creates distance in between in such a gloomy environment. To some it may feel like the she is walking off toward the Golden Gate Bridge which could symbolize her own suicide, or death, or it could symbolize the act of moving forward into something vast. It could also symbolize mourning for someone else and a feeling of love, or care. In terms of the audio, I decided to use the sounds of firetruck alarms, fire alarms, rain, the sound of a cable car moving down the streets of San Francisco, and thunder. I formulated them to create a sense of emergency. Are they coming to rescue her? Is the incident somewhere nearby? Do the sounds symbolize the death of her friend and she has come to mourn for that person? …Of course, this is up to the viewer to create their own narration.</p>
