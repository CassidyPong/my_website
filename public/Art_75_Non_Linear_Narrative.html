				<p>For this project, I wanted to explore the idea of dreams and nightmares in a very abstract way. Instead of representing the idea with clear imagery and presenting objects as a whole, I decided to focus on certain parts of objects, change them into black and white imagery, and paired it with certain eerie sounds to distort the object and feeling into something else. Furthermore, I wanted to explore the non-linearity of our subconscious and how dreams can skip from one scene to another. Overall, it is ultimately up to the viewer to decide on how they see this video.

				The first video begins with the base of a wine glass that rocks side to side. Paired with a sound of a bell or grandfather clock chime, it begins to morph into a pendulum; representing time and a distortion of space, the speed of it varies to show that time is but a figment of imagination in dreams/nightmares. Next, a wispy draft appears as a transition paired with a sound of wind. However, the fimled subject itself is water. The movement of the water changes direction and morphs from wind, to water, to noise/grain bringing forth a sense of uncertainty, the unknown, and constant change. The next scene consists of a pair of feet walking in different directions: toward the camera, across the camera, away, and disappearing. This also represents the non-linearity of dreams and nightmares but can also represent many other things such as the unknown, fear, and moving away, from, or toward a destination. Who is this figure? What is his/her identity, what are his/her intentions? And finally, the video repeats itself again and the water creeps back in with the "chime" of the "pendulum," signifying a distortion back into the abstract and uncertainty.

				The second video takes a different direction to the idea of dreams and nightmares. First it begins with a close up shot of a headset stand made in a previous class. Using the focus lens to blur in and out, the scene starts to become what looks like a beating heart. Paired with eerie sounds, a creeking door, and a pumping heart, the pulses increase in certain moments, representing fear and anxiety. Then everything goes silent and a candle shows. Slowly, in complete silence, the video takes on a first person perspective as we look through "eye blinks" staring at a candle. Is the person awake? Or are they still dreaming? Does the candle represent hope or impending doom? That is up to the viewer to decide.
