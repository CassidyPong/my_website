				<p>Artist’s Statement:</p>
			  
				<p> The idea of death is an uncomfortable one: whether it is suicide, murder, or the natural death of a loved one, the passing of a person can be disheartening and grim. Eventually, everyone will face the inevitability of a loved one’s death… but it does not have to always be so gloomy and bitter. 
				In my work, I wanted to address this uncomfortable topic without portraying a specific message. Though the work itself is displayed in black and white (to enhance the mood with the use of light and shadow), the symbols of each image placed to create the digital montage each contain their own meaning. To make meaning out of the compiled images is completely up to the viewer. For example, some people may see the Golden Gate Bridge as an area of chaos, a hot spot for countless suicides, or they may identify the Golden Gate Bridge as a gateway to opportunity, new beginnings, hope, and persistence. In addition, elements such as the umbrella, the roses, candles, butterfly, and moon can each hold their own significant meanings whether they are negative or positive. 
				The process of developing and executing my triptych, to the creation of its animation, and the addition of sound was rather interesting. On the behalf of wanting to portray such an uncomfortable subject, I did not want to make the meaning of the work stale or monotone (ie. only portraying suicide or death of a person to provoke a feeling of sorrow). Instead, using Lev Manovich’s second principle of “Modularity,” I built off the base idea of “death” to compile different images together to create a complex portrayal of death with each image contributing to the whole: On one hand, it can characterize dark feelings such as sorrow, mourning, despair, fear, confrontation, and desolation. However, when viewed in a different light, the images can produce a plethora of different meanings such as hope, progression, strength, determination, dedication, acceptance, and perseverance. Each image was strategically picked with many, if not all, consisting of multiple meanings. 
				 </p>

				<p>Note:

				This piece to me was rather personal. Though not all of my work always includes such uncomfortable topics, I feel that we should not always shy away from such depressing emotions and feelings and thoughts. Of course, it should be limited to some degree but not everyone is happy every single day. We are only human. Majority of us go through our own hardships whether it is financially, emotionally, or physically. I also believe that art can be so much stronger when it is personally meaningful. Art is subjective and can be liked or disliked by anyone. However, it becomes so much more powerful when you can tie it to yourself and others. </p>
