				<p><strong> Artist’s Statement:</strong></p>
			  
				<p> 
					Because winter is coming soon, I wanted to incorporate the concept of Christmas and what we could typically see on a Christmas day into this project. I created two still life scenes: the first scene is within the snow globe itself that contains a penguin, a polar bear, and an orca flying through the air, while the other scene depicts the environment in which the snow globe stands with two Christmas ornaments on each side. I wanted to keep the still life somewhat realistic by making the ornaments shiny and smooth to reflect the Christmas theme lighting and by taking advantage of the noise/grain as if there was a blizzard in the snow globe. I also wanted to keep the plastic/ static feel of a snow globe by keeping the details of the environment inside rather simple and smooth. Of course, the structure of the contents of the snow globe may seem impossible because they are floating in the air, but I wanted to reflect that "magical" feeling of a snow globe through this impossible placement of the objects. Overall, the objects are placed on a wooden surface as if they were center pieces on a table or stand. The dim lighting is soft and subtle, and the colors of red, white, and green bring forth a festive feel of Christmas.
