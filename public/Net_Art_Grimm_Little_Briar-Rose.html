				<p>A long time ago there were a King and Queen who said every day, "Ah, 
				if only we had a child!" but they never had one. But it happened that 
				once when the Queen was bathing, a frog crept out of the water on to the 
				land, and said to her, "Your wish shall be fulfilled; before a year has 
				gone by, you shall have a daughter."</p>
				
				<p>What the frog had said came true, and the Queen had a little girl who 
				was so pretty that the King could not contain himself for joy, and 
				ordered a great feast.  He invited not only his kindred, friends and 
				acquaintance, but also the Wise Women, in order that they might be kind 
				and well-disposed towards the child.  There were thirteen of them in his 
				kingdom, but, as he had only twelve golden plates for them to eat out of, 
				one of them had to be left at home.</p>
				
				<p>The feast was held with all manner of splendour and when it came to an 
				end the Wise Women bestowed their magic gifts upon the baby: one gave 
				virtue, another beauty, a third riches, and so on with everything in 
				the world that one can wish for.</p>
				
				<p>When eleven of them had made their promises, suddenly the thirteenth 
				came in.  She wished to avenge herself for not having been invited, 
				and without greeting, or even looking at any one, she cried with a loud 
				voice, "The King's daughter shall in her fifteenth year prick herself 
				with a spindle, and fall down dead." And, without saying a word more, 
				she turned round and left the room.</p> 
				
				<p>They were all shocked; but the twelfth, whose good wish still remained 
				unspoken, came forward, and as she could not undo the evil sentence, 
				but only soften it, she said, "It shall not be death, but a deep sleep 
				of a hundred years, into which the princess shall fall."  
				The King, who would fain keep his dear child from the misfortune, gave 
				orders that every spindle in the whole kingdom should be burnt. Meanwhile 
				the gifts of the Wise Women were plenteously fulfilled on the young girl, 
				for she was so beautiful, modest, good-natured, and wise, that everyone 
				who saw her was bound to love her.</p>
				
				<p>It happened that on the very day when she was fifteen years old, the King 
				and Queen were not at home, and the maiden was left in the palace quite 
				alone. So she went round into all sorts of places, looked into rooms and 
				bed-chambers just as she liked, and at last came to an old tower. She 
				climbed up the narrow winding-staircase, and reached a little door. A 
				rusty key was in the lock, and when she turned it the door sprang open, 
				and there in a little room sat an old woman with a spindle, busily 
				spinning her flax.</p>
				
				<p>"Good day, old dame," said the King's daughter; "what are you doing 
				there?" "I am spinning," said the old woman, and nodded her head. "What 
				sort of thing is that, that rattles round so merrily?" said the girl, 
				and she took the spindle and wanted to spin too. But scarcely had she 
				touched the spindle when the magic decree was fulfilled, and she pricked 
				her finger with it.</p> 
			 
				<p>And, in the very moment when she felt the prick, she fell down upon the 
				bed that stood there, and lay in a deep sleep. And this sleep extended 
				over the whole palace; the King and Queen who had just come home, 
				and had entered the great hall, began to go to sleep, and the whole 
				of the court with them. The horses, too, went to sleep in the stable, 
				the dogs in the yard, the pigeons upon the roof, the flies on the wall; 
				even the fire that was flaming on the hearth became quiet and slept, 
				the roast meat left off frizzling, and the cook, who was just going to 
				pull the hair of the scullery boy, because he had forgotten something, 
				let him go, and went to sleep. And the wind fell, and on the trees before 
				the castle not a leaf moved again.</p>
				
				<p>But round about the castle there began to grow a hedge of thorns, 
				which every year became higher, and at last grew close up round the 
				castle and all over it, so that there was nothing of it to be seen, not 
				even the flag upon the roof. But the story of the beautiful sleeping 
				"Briar-rose," for so the princess was named, went about the country, 
				so that from time to time kings' sons came and tried to get through the 
				thorny hedge into the castle.</p>
				
				<p>But they found it impossible, for the thorns held fast together, as if 
				they had hands, and the youths were caught in them, could not get loose 
				again, and died a miserable death.</p>
				
				<p>After long, long years a King's son came again to that country, and 
				heard an old man talking about the thorn-hedge, and that a castle was  
				said to stand behind it in which a wonderfully beautiful princess, 
				named Briar-rose, had been asleep for a hundred years; and that the 
				King and Queen and the whole court were asleep likewise. He had heard, 
				too, from his grandfather, that many kings' sons had already come, 
				and had tried to get through the thorny hedge, but they had remained 
				sticking fast in it, and had died a pitiful death. Then the youth said, 
				"I am not afraid, I will go and see the beautiful Briar-rose." The good 
				old man might dissuade him as he would, he did not listen to his words.</p>
				
				<p>But by this time the hundred years had just passed, and the day had come 
				when Briar-rose was to awake again. When the King's son came near to 
				the thorn-hedge, it was nothing but large and beautiful flowers, which 
				parted from each other of their own accord, and let him pass unhurt, 
				then they closed again behind him like a hedge. In the castle-yard he 
				saw the horses and the spotted hounds lying asleep; on the roof sat the 
				pigeons with their heads under their wings. And when he entered the house, 
				the flies were asleep upon the wall, the cook in the kitchen was still 
				holding out his hand to seize the boy, and the maid was sitting by the 
				black hen which she was going to pluck.</p>
				
				<p>He went on farther, and in the great hall he saw the whole of the court 
				lying asleep, and up by the throne lay the King and Queen.</p>
				
				<p>Then he went on still farther, and all was so quiet that a breath could 
				be heard, and at last he came to the tower, and opened the door into the 
				little room where Briar-rose was sleeping. There she lay, so beautiful 
				that he could not turn his eyes away; and he stooped down and gave her a 
				kiss. But as soon as he kissed her, Briar-rose opened her eyes and awoke, 
				and looked at him quite sweetly.</p>
				
				<p>Then they went down together, and the King awoke, and the Queen, and 
				the whole court, and looked at each other in great astonishment. And 
				the horses in the court-yard stood up and shook themselves; the hounds 
				jumped up and wagged their tails; the pigeons upon the roof pulled out 
				their heads from under their wings, looked round, and flew into the open 
				country; the flies on the wall crept again; the fire in the kitchen burned 
				up and flickered and cooked the meat; the joint began to turn and frizzle 
				again, and the cook gave the boy such a box on the ear that he screamed, 
				and the maid plucked the fowl ready for the spit.</p>
				
				<p>And then the marriage of the King's son with Briar-rose was celebrated 
				with all splendour, and they lived contented to the end of their days. </p>

		<p>Once upon a time, a king and a queen were desperately wishing to have a child.
		After a long wait, a frog tells the queen she'll soon become a mother to a girl. 
		The prophecy fulfills and king and queen decide to have a big party to celebrate 
		the birth of their child, Briar-Rose.They invite everybody including the fairies. 
		But because they have only twelve golden plates, they invite only twelve of the 
		thirteen fairies. When the uninvited one finds out, she curses the child. The baby 
		will prick herself with a spindle on her fifteen's birthday and die. </p>
		
		<p>Only one of the fairies has yet to give a gift to the child, so she softens the
		death curse into a hundred years of sleep. Not only the child, but everybody in 
		the castle will fall asleep too. The king tries to avoid the fate and orders to 
		destroy all the spindles in the kingdom. Of course his plan fails. </p>
		
		<p>On her fifteenth birthday, Briar-Rose finds a secret room in the castle's tower, 
		where an old lady spins a thread. She wonders what is she doing, touches the spindle 
		and falls asleep.Everybody in the castle sleeps for one hundred years and a 
		forest full of thorns surrounds it. Many heroes try to get through but nobody succeeds.</p>
		
		<p>After one hundred years, a king's son comes to the forest where the enchanted
		castle and sleeping beauty are supposed to be. The forest makes a free path for
		him, he enters the castle and wakes up the sleeping princess with a kiss.</p>
