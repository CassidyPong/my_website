			<p> For this project, I wanted to make use of the CNC laser cutter to make a headset stand in the shape of a treble cleft. In a way, the design itself 
			and its functionality plays on the concept of "play." First, the treble cleft is a common symbol seen in music. In my opinion, one could argue that 
			music is a universal language; practically every culture has their own type of music that can be celebratory, joyful, sad, relaxing, etc. Its functionality
			as a headset stand also ties in with the concept of "play." I play a lot of computer games and listen to a lot of music, so it serves as a nice resting place 
			for my headset. Also, because I listen to a lot of music, the design of the headset stand just fits with the headset as a device that plays sound. 
			</p>
			
			<p> The process for creating this headset stand was rather simplistic. First I started with an AI file consisting of two designs: the treble cleft symbol itself
			and two cover panels for the lights.
			</p>
			
			<p><img src="images/CNC_project_template.jpg"/></p>
			
			<p> Using the laser cutter, I cut out 2 pieces of .22" thick acrylic, 2 pieces of .125" thick acryclic, and seven pieces of .25" plywood. Next, I layered the
			pieces together starting from two layers of plywood, .125" acryclic, plywood, .22" acryclic, plywood, .22" acryclic, plywood, .125" acryclic, and finally 
			two layers of wood for a total of eleven layers. Then, I superglued all the pieces together and sanded down the edges starting from 100 grit sandpaper, to 400
			grit sandpaper. To ensure that my headset would not get ruined by the edges of the stand, I sanded the curves where my headset rested. After doing my best
			sanding the entired thing down, trying to make areas sit flush with one another, I bought a small, square-shaped box from Michaels. I removed the hinge from 
			box and used my dremel to create a rectangular hole in the base relative to the size of the gap underneath my headset stand (this will become my base for 
			my headset stand). After gluing the treble clef to the base, I coated the entire piece with 3 coats danish oil. Then, I coated the entired piece once more
			with 2 coats of polyurethane. After the polyurethane had set for a few days, I started to work on the lighting. 
			</p>
			
			<p><img src="images/cnc_project_back.JPG"/></p>
			
			<p> For the lighting, I used LED strips that came in increments of 5 (if I were to make another headset stand, I would use a strip that had LED's coming in
			increments of 3). Unfortunately, I did not calculate how the light would diffuse throughout the whole piece. At first, I thought about lighting the piece from
			underneath, however, the complex shape of the treble cleft did not provide enough material for the light to pass completely through. So, I decided to light
			the piece from each hole. Having lights that came in increments of 5 made it difficult to fit the lights into smaller holes; unfortunately, the strip would 
			not light up if cut any shorter. After planning out how each strip attatched to one another, I soldered all the lights into one strip and stuck them into 
			each respective hole using the tape backing already attatched to the lights. All the was left was to create a small notch in the base with my dremel so that
			the wire does not get squished when placed on a flat surface.</p>
			
			<p> The lights came with a remote controller that allows me to light the piece in a multitude of colors, 20 set colors to be exact. You can also change the 
			brightness and select certain effects such as "flash," "fade," "quick," "slow," and you can program the lights to your liking.</p>
