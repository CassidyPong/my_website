<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
<div class="text2">
    <p>I often think of my artwork as an extension of myself. Throughout my life, it has always been a medium in which I convey my personal thoughts and emotions that I have felt and experienced. By placing myself into my work, I am able to make a better connection to myself, my practice, and to my audience. My work mainly focuses on uncomfortable subjects including topics such as depression, the loss of a loved one, and suicide, however, I also like to explore anything that peaks my interest or experiment with different mediums and ideas. The subject matter of each body of work determines what materials I use or what the focus of the work will be. I work in a variety of different mediums but mainly focus on creating digital artwork including digital imagery, video, web development, projection mapping, and game design. However, I also create physical artworks, such as 3D printing, traditional drawing and painting, and 3D sculpture.</p>
